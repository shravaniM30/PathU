    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <div>
            <p>Shaniwar Wada, a magnificent relic of the Maratha Empire, is a testament to the grandeur and strategic brilliance of its time. Built in 1732 by Peshwa Baji Rao I, it served as the power center for the Peshwas, showcasing their architectural finesse and political dominance. The fort once boasted five massive gates, robust fortifications, secret chambers, majestic fountains, and sprawling courtyards, reflecting the opulence of Maratha rule. It also housed a nine-story palace, adorned with intricate teak wood carvings and adorned ceilings that exuded splendor.
              <br><br>
            However, Shaniwar Wada is not just a monument of beauty but also a witness to some of history's most dramatic episodes, including royal conspiracies, betrayal, and tragic conflicts. The infamous fire of 1828 consumed much of its original structure, leaving behind ruins that still whisper tales of its glorious past.
              <br><br>
            Today, Shaniwar Wada is a popular heritage site, attracting thousands of visitors who come to admire its remnants and experience its history through the engaging light-and-sound show held every evening. The fort remains a symbol of Pune's rich cultural identity, offering an inspiring journey into the legacy of the Marathas, their artistry, and their enduring spirit.
