    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <div>
            <p>The Aga Khan Palace was built as an act of charity to provide employment to the famine-stricken people of Pune during the late 19th century. Over the years, it became a prominent symbol of India’s struggle for independence. Mahatma Gandhi and his wife Kasturba Gandhi were imprisoned here by the British during the Quit India Movement in 1942. The palace holds a deep historical significance, as Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai, Gandhi’s secretary, passed away within its walls.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Today, the palace stands as a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, housing a museum with rare photographs, personal belongings, and a room preserved as a tribute to the Father of the Nation. Its beautifully landscaped gardens and serene environment attract tourists, historians, and peace seekers from across the globe.</p>
